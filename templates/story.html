        <h2>Who are we?</h2>
        <p>We are 3 world renowned chefs by the names; Kirt, Tahsin and Yousuf.
            Each of us specialise in different cuisines; American, Asian and European.

        <h2>Where did it all start?</h2>

            the the worlds greatest chef. After the competition, we decided to settle our differences and work together
        and use our powers for the greater good</p>

        <p>So we are 3 different chefs who have come together from different corners of the world for one purpose... </p>
